# Life Explorer üß≠
LifeExplorer is an app that allows you to navigate and learn about the incredibly diverse collection of biodiversity found on planet Earth.
This app uses the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/) API in order to provide the taxinomical classification of any known species.

## Features

- Evolution Map:
This is a map of how all living creatures including plants üå±, animals ü¶ë, fungi üçÑ, and bacteria ü¶† evolved over millions of years since the orgin of life.
The Map allows you to zoom into any specific section and scrolll around to see the relationship between different species and learn when they diverged from one another.

- Search:
The search feature allows the user to input the name of a specific species in order to get the full taxinomical classification of that species!

- News:
This section will eventually provide new research papers and articles to read on the development of new recorded species, their behaviours and more! This demo simply illustrates how they may be presented in future updates.

## Future Updates:
Some features to develop with further updates include:
- Making the map interactive, allowing the user to click on a species and have information be displayed.
- Use the GBIF API to show more information about each species on the search page as well as including an image of the specific species. The GBIF API has fantastic resources to display maps of where the species is most commonly found and so much more.
- Integrate the news section of the GBIF API to show new exciting research papers in the news section of the app.

## How To Install The App
The app is not currently on the app store, however if you would like to run this app on your local machine simply run the main.dart file by connecting to an IOS simulator. On Mac one should be included with Xcode.
